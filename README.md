## Installing PhasByPass
In order to be able to run our Mod, we'll need to install the PhasBypass DLL.

At this point, it would be a good idea to test your setup by starting Phasmaphobia and playing a quick round. This will give you a good indication of whether MelonLoader and the PhasBypass.dll are working correctly, as they tend to break easily with each new release.
